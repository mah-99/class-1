            <p>It might take another two weeks for the load shedding situation to become<br>
            normal, said state minister for power, energy, and mineral resources Nasrul<br>
            Hamid.</p>
            <p>“The consumers have been observing for a few days that the load shedding has<br>
                  increased. We were having problems to supply gas, coal and oil. That is why load<br>
                  shedding has gradually increased. Now the situation has become unbearable,”<br>
                  said Nasrul Hamid.</p>
                  <br><br>

            <p>The state minister was talking to media regarding the ongoing load shedding<br>
            situation across the country at his secretariat office on Sunday.<br></p>

            <p>He said, "The authorities have been trying hard how fast it can import coal for<br>
                  Payra power plant. Currently the power plant has been operating with half of its <br>
                  capacity. Barapukuria coal fired power plant is also operating with half of its <br>
                  capacity. Even the fuel oil run power plants are also operating with half of their <br>
                  capacity. The power division has been trying to resolve the problem very soon.”</p>

            <p>Nasrul Hamid, however, said they do not have any plan so far to manage load <br>
                  shedding by drawing a roster like July in the last year.</p>
                  <br>
            <p>“The demand of power has increased as heatwave is sweeping over the country.<br>
                  The amount of load shedding is 2500MW. We have been trying to bring that<br>
                  down. The situation may be normal within the next 10-15 days,” he added.</p>
                  <p>In response to a question on the capacity of power production, the state minister <br>
                        said the plants are ready to operate. The attempts were being made from two <br>
                        months ago. But the background issues of bringing fuel are not in their hands <br>
                        always. There are economic issues, opening of LC (letter of credit); coordination <br>
                        is necessary for everything. Problems appear if this coordination faces obstacles<br>
                        anywhere. This is what happened this time too.</p>
